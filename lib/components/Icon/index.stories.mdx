# Icon

There are over 1000 icons included inside the library. We use a licensed version of th Glyphicons library, [available here](https://www.glyphicons.com/sets/basic/).

> For purposes of reducing the overall size of the library, we do not export the icons explicitly. Therefore, when requiring an icon,
you must import it directly.

## Import

```js
import { Airplane } from '@firstclasspostcodes/sw14/lib/components/Icon';
// or
import Airplane from '@firstclasspostcodes/sw14/lib/components/Icon/Airplane';
```

## Example

<Preview>
  <Story name="Fill">
    <Airplane color="brand" size="4"/>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Outlined">
    <SquareEmpty color="brand" size="4"/>
  </Story>
</Preview>
